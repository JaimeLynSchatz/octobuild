Octobuild
=========

# The idea is

That we make a list of projects we're working on in October that we're proud of. That's it. Huge passion projects, things at work, what I like to call fiddle projects from Saturday afternoons, non-code projects that have a home online, or that chapter of the book you've been writing for years.

Just saying you're working on a project and telling others, I've found, is monumentally helpful towards *getting it done*. And that's what we're all about. So tell us what we're working on. This is just for October - like [NaNoWriMo](http://nanowrimo.org/), having a timeline helps. Unlike NaNoWriMo, no one is keeping score, and you don't have to finish it or not. I'll check up with you at the end of October to ask how you've done, and post a list of finished projects or work done. 

# The list is

Here:

* [Octobuild](github.com/octobuild) by [RichardLitt](https://github.com/RichardLitt). This is a month long project board where you post what you're working on, and can see what other cool people are working on. That's it. 

# You Can Add To It

by going here: https://github.com/RichardLitt/octobuild/edit/gh-pages/README.md. That's all! Add your name and a link and a short paragraph.

# Originally,

Octobuild was an idea for a month long online hackathon. [@simonv3](https://twitter.com/simonv3) and I would build a large webapp, invite people to join teams, post their ideas, track their progress, give out prizes, and in the process aquire fame, fortune, and fan the flames for open source hacking. 

*This didn't pan out.* Why? Well, for one, we both have too many projects going on. Two, I am not the best at marketing. Have you heard of [IdeaOtter](http://ideaotter.com), a web app for sharing your ideas and recording them for later, targeted towards entrepreneurs? If you have, I'm surprised. Three, we almost got sued for a name clash with Appril, in the Netherlands, which was awkward as we didn't know they existed at all before we started getting phone calls. Four, we both realised that it's not what we love - we love hacking together projects and communities, but not necessarily managing the two. 

[@mijustin](https://twitter.com/mijustin) suggested reviving dead domains. So, I decided to do something much simpler. And here we are. I like this more. 

*Disclaimer:* Octobuild is in no way affiliated with Github's Octocat, although this is hosted on Github Pages and I think Github is awesome.
